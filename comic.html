  <h1> These are the <u>best</u><br/> comics of 2017</h1>
   <h2><li> Vision<p><img src="https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/system/images/photo_albums/marvel2016/large/vision.jpg?1384968217"></li></h2>
      <p><h3>The Vision wants to be human, and what's more human than family?<br/>
         He goes to the laboratory where he was created, where Ultron molded <br/>
         him into a weapon, where he first rebelled against his given destiny,<br/>
         where he first imagined that he could be more, that he could be good,<br/>
         that he could be a man, a normal, ordinary man. And he builds them. <br/>
         A wife, Virginia. Two teenage twins, Viv and Vin. They look like him. <br/>
         They have his powers. They share his grandest ambition or perhaps obsession: <br/>
         the unrelenting need to be ordinary. Behold The Visions! They're the <br/>
         family next door, and they have the power to kill us all. 
          What could possibly go wrong?</h3>
